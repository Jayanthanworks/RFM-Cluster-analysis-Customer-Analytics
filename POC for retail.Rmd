# Business Background : 
# Industry :FMCD (COnsumer Durable)
# The Retail Brand Store 'X' has got a database of 15406 unique customers in the from 2011 to 2016.
# The Sales data is of datewise/monthwise and model wise purchase

# Business Objective : 
#1)To understand the retail consumer purchase pattern 
#2)To drive special loyalty program for Value customers  
#3)To Identify segments for Targeted marketing activities for the store
 
                        

# Concepts Exploration: 
#1)RFM Analysis - ( Recency,Frequency,Monetory)
#2)Heirarchial Clustering method for segmenting the customer    

                      
# Flowchart on Model : 
#1) find RFM metrics for the customers who billed on till year 2016                         
#2) Exploration with Histogram on multiple parameters     
#3) Compute Distance metrics
#4) To Create a hierarchical cluster.
#5) To Create Dendogram which comes out with suggested cluster Tree 
#6)To Subset a given cluster with cutomer ID and customerID'slinked cluster.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
